# Lazulight.lxl
> Lite XL language plugins with more specific highlight groups/types.

Lazulight is a collection of Lite XL languages with additional
highlight types to have more colors for specific parts of language
syntax.

This is to address issue [#1000], and the hope is that the the language
plugins here will be upstreamed.

[#1000]: https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/issues/1000

> This is work in progress! The highlight groups may change
sporadically.

# Supported Languages
- [ ] Go (partially)

- `type_builtin`: Builtin type declaration
